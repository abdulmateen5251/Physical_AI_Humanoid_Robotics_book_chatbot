- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain

- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria

- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Clarification Resolved**:
- FR-011: Selected Option A - Recommendations refresh on next page load (after profile save). This provides good UX while maintaining simpler implementation without requiring real-time infrastructure.

**Validation Status**: ✅ Complete. All checklist items pass. Specification ready for `/sp.plan` phase.
